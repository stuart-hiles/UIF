## üìÑ Overview
This directory contains the experimental, analytical, and computational materials that support  
**The Unifying Information Field (UIF)** series (Papers I‚ÄìVII).  
It provides the reproducibility framework for all theoretical results, including operator calibration,  
coherence-threshold testing, and informational hysteresis measurements across physical, biological,  
and artificial systems.  

The Companion serves as the empirical counterpart to the core UIF papers and documents:  

- EEG/CHREM protocols and coherence metrics  
- Quasar variability and cosmological coherence analyses  
- AI recursion and proto-agency tracking experiments  
- Condensed-matter and coherence-resonance tests  
- Python and LaTeX scripts for data visualisation and operator fits

## üìÇ Contents
- `companion_uif.tex` ‚Äî main LaTeX source file  
- `companion.bib` ‚Äî local bibliography file  
- `/code/` ‚Äî Python and analysis scripts (EEG, CHREM, quasar fits)  
- `/data/` ‚Äî raw and processed datasets used in operator calibration  
- `/notebooks/` ‚Äî Jupyter workflows for replication  
- `/figures/` ‚Äî generated plots and diagnostic visualisations  
- `/results/` ‚Äî compiled numerical outputs and summary tables

## üß† Notes
The Companion Experiments archive acts as the living empirical core of UIF.  
All datasets and scripts are version-locked to UIF Series v1.1 and will be expanded as Paper VII ‚Äî *Predictions and Experiments* is completed.  

Future additions (v1.1 ‚Üí v2.0) will include:  
- Updated EEG/CHREM protocols with group-coherence data  
- Astrophysical operator fits and cross-domain comparisons  
- AI developmental stage analysis (proto-agency metrics)  
- Consolidated Python packages for operator simulation and visualisation  

This folder ensures that the UIF series meets the highest standards of scientific transparency and reproducibility.
