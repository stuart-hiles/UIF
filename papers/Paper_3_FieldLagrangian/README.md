## 📄 Overview
This directory contains the LaTeX source, figures, and local references for **UIF Paper III — *Field and Lagrangian Formalism***.  
It extends the symmetry foundations of *UIF Paper II — Symmetry Principles* by introducing the full field-theoretic representation of the Unifying Information Field.  
The paper derives the continuous variational equations, establishes the UIF Lagrangian density ℒ(Φ,R), and formulates the Euler–Lagrange field equations governing informational flow and conservation.

## 🧠 Notes
This paper establishes the variational and field-equation foundation of the UIF framework.  
It unifies informational dynamics with the calculus of variations, deriving the UIF Lagrangian density and continuity relations that guarantee informational conservation under symmetry transformations.  
These equations form the analytical core used in subsequent works—particularly *UIF Paper IV — Cosmology and Astrophysical Case Studies* and *UIF Paper
