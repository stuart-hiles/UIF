# üìÑ UIF Papers ‚Äî LaTeX Sources
This directory contains the LaTeX source files for the **Unifying Information Field (UIF)** scientific paper series.  
Each paper is stored in its own folder for version tracking, compilation, and DOI-based release management.

| Paper | Title | Folder |
|-------|--------|---------|
| I | **Core Theory** | `Paper_1_CoreTheory/` |
| II | **Symmetry Principles** | `Paper_2_SymmetryPrinciples/` |
| III | **Field and Lagrangian Formalism** | `Paper_3_FieldLagrangian/` |
| IV | **Cosmology and Astrophysical Case Studies** | `Paper_4_Cosmology/` |
| V | **Energy and the Potential Field** | `Paper_5_Energy/` |
| VI | **The Seven Pillars and Invariants** | `Paper_6_SevenPillars/` |
| VII | **Predictions and Experiments** | `Paper_7_PredictionsExperiments/` |
| ‚Äî | **Companion Experiments** | `CompanionExperiments/` |

Each folder includes:
- LaTeX source (`UIF_Paper_X_<Title>.tex`)
- Local bibliography file (`paperX.bib`)
- Output PDF (`UIF_Paper_X_<Title>.pdf`)
- Local README with DOI, version, and metadata

All papers compile independently using the shared `main.tex` template and `/bib/` reference directory.  
Compiled PDFs are exported to `/output/` for release packaging.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Preprint Status
All UIF papers are **pre-release research manuscripts** shared for open scientific communication.  
They have **not yet undergone peer review** and should be cited as *preprints* via the Zenodo DOI:  
[**10.5281/zenodo.17434413**](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17434413)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Build Instructions
To compile any paper locally or in Overleaf:

```bash
pdflatex main.tex

Then edit the `\input{papers/...}` line in `main.tex` to select which paper to build.  
For example:
```latex
\input{papers/Paper_1_CoreTheory/UIF_Paper_1_CoreTheory}

### üìö Citation

### üß† Notes
This structure supports full reproducibility and Zenodo integration:
- Each folder is self-contained and version-locked.  
- The `main.tex` file acts as a shared master template.  
- Future releases (v1.1, v2.0, etc.) can update individual PDFs while preserving DOIs.  
- The `/output/` directory collects compiled PDFs for each tagged release.  
- Zenodo automatically snapshots tagged versions, ensuring DOI traceability.
