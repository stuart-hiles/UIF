## 📄 Overview
This directory contains the LaTeX source, figures, and local references for **UIF Paper II — *Symmetry Principles***.  
It extends the operator grammar defined in *UIF Paper I — Core Theory* by developing the symmetry and invariance relations that govern informational conservation across all scales.  
The paper introduces Noether-style conservation laws for informational difference (ΔI) and demonstrates how symmetry transformations preserve coherence within the receive–return field R(x,t).

## 🧠 Notes
This paper formalises the symmetry and invariance laws underpinning the UIF framework.  
It establishes the mathematical continuity between informational conservation and classical Noether currents, preparing the foundation for *UIF Paper III — Field and Lagrangian Formalism.*  
Future updates (v1.1, v2.0, etc.) will preserve DOI continuity and archival provenance via Zenodo + GitHub release tags.
