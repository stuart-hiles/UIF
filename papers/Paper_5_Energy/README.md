## 📄 Overview
This directory contains the LaTeX source, figures, and local references for **UIF Paper V — *Energy and the Potential Field***.  
It extends the cosmological and field analyses of *UIF Paper IV — Cosmology and Astrophysical Case Studies* by developing the energetic formulation of the informational substrate.  
The paper defines the UIF potential field Φ(x,t), the energy-exchange operator V(Φ; β), and the variational relationships that link informational curvature to measurable energy density.  
It formalises the equivalence between informational flow and energetic exchange, establishing the bridge between UIF dynamics and thermodynamic observables.

## 🧠 Notes
This paper formalises the energetic interpretation of the informational field, showing that every collapse–return cycle carries a quantised energetic cost proportional to ΔI.  
It introduces the UIF potential V(Φ; β) as the storage term for unsampled informational energy and derives the logistic ceiling R∞ and re
