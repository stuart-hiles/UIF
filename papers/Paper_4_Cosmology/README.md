## 📄 Overview
This directory contains the LaTeX source, figures, and local references for **UIF Paper IV — *Cosmology and Astrophysical Case Studies***.  
It applies the field-equation formalism developed in *UIF Paper III — Field and Lagrangian Formalism* to astrophysical and cosmological phenomena.  
The paper analyses quasar variability, gravitational-wave echoes, dark-substrate coherence, and CMB residuals as empirical manifestations of the collapse–return dynamics predicted by UIF.  
These case studies provide the first large-scale observational tests of the informational field operators (ΔI, Γ, λᴿ, R∞, k).
