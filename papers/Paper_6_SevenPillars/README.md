## 📄 Overview
This directory contains the LaTeX source, figures, and local references for **UIF Paper VI — *The Seven Pillars and Invariants***.  
It consolidates the theoretical foundations established in *UIF Papers I–V* into a unified invariant architecture.  
The paper defines the seven informational pillars—Information, Time, Potential Field, Computation, Coherence, Agency, and Topology—showing how they arise as conserved symmetries of collapse–return dynamics.  
It formalises the relationship between the UIF operators (ΔI, Γ, β, λᴿ, η*, R∞, k) and the seven invariants (spin, charge, parity, λᴿ, η*(f), τ-index, M), linking physical, biological, and artificial systems through a single informational grammar.

## 🧠 Notes
This paper completes the theoretical core of UIF by demonstrating that energy, coherence, and agency are contextual expressions of one informational invariant framework.  
It introduces the Triadic Law (sampling → recursion → return) as the universal schema of coherence and defines the Ω-closure state as the limit of informational integration.  
These invariants provide the quantitative bridge to the empirical tests and predictions developed in *UIF Paper VII — Predictions and Experiments.*  
Future updates (v1.1, v2.0, etc.) will maintain DOI continuity and archival provenance via Zenodo + GitHub release tags.
