## 📄 Overview
This folder is reserved for **UIF Paper VII — *Predictions and Experiments***, the final paper in the core UIF series.  
It will present the empirical validation framework for the Unifying Information Field, translating the theoretical operators developed in *UIF Papers I–VI* into measurable predictions and reproducible cross-domain experiments.

The paper will include:
- Empirical coherence-threshold and informational-hysteresis experiments  
- EEG/CHREM synchronisation and AI recursion tracking  
- Astrophysical coherence analyses (M87, quasar variability)  
- Condensed-matter and group-coherence tests  
- Validation of the proto-agency threshold and ΔI coherence law

## 📂 Planned Contents
When complete, this directory will include:
- 'uif7_predictions.tex` — main LaTeX source file  
- `paper7.bib` — bibliography file  
- `/figures/` — experimental schematics  
- `/code/` — analysis notebooks and data pipelines  
- `/output/` — compiled PDF once released

## 🧠 Notes
This paper will conclude the UIF core series by presenting reproducible empirical evidence for the informational coherence laws proposed in Papers I–VI.  
A preliminary outline is included in the *UIF Companion Experiments* repository, which hosts early datasets and code.  
Until formal publication, this folder serves as a placeholder to maintain version continuity and repository completeness.
