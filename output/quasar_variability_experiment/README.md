UIF Quasar Variability Experiment — Output Folder
=================================================

Status: RESERVED (experiment not yet executed)

This directory is reserved for future outputs from the UIF Quasar Variability Experiment, 
which will analyse quasar time-domain variability (light-curve dynamics) to estimate UIF 
operators from temporal behaviour — including:

 • DRW/continuous-time stochastic process fits
 • Variability timescale (τ) and variance (σ) estimation
 • Variability-driven coherence metrics
 • UIF operator mapping (ΔI, Γ, λR, R∞, k) from variability
 • Cross-comparison with scaling and cosmology experiments

No outputs are currently available
----------------------------------
The variability experiment has NOT yet been run, and therefore no generated data, figures, 
or summary files exist at this time.

Related Completed Experiments
-----------------------------
For quasar-based analyses already implemented in UIF, see:

 • UIF/output/quasar_scaling_experiment
 • UIF/output/quasar_cosmology_experiment

These contain the full suite of quasar scaling relations, coherence analytics, and 
cosmology-lite emulator outputs referenced in the UIF papers.

Future Work
-----------
This folder will eventually contain:

 • τ–σ DRW fits
 • Variability-derived coherence metrics
 • Time-domain κ-maps
 • Variability-driven operator estimates (ΔI, Γ, λR, R∞, k)
 • Reproducibility summary (JSON)
 • Figures used in future UIF Companion papers (Variability section)
