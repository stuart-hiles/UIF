# Informational Difference Calibration - UIF Experiement 1 (Cosmology-Lite Emulator) — Output Directory  
(Experiments I–V)

This folder contains all diagnostic outputs generated by the
UIF Cosmology-Lite Emulator during Experiments I–V of the
UIF Companion Experiments.

These files include γ-sweep maps, threshold (η*, λᴿ) stability diagrams,
κ-power spectra, hysteresis diagnostics, and summary statistics used
in cosmological-operator calibration.

No raw data is stored here — only emulator-derived products.

### 🔷 **Data Tables (CSV)**  
These are machine-readable analysis tables used in the paper.

- gamma_sweep.csv  
  Table of ⟨s⟩, γ, pruning counts, and coherence diagnostics for γ-sweep experiments.

- threshold_map.csv  
  Stability matrix for η* × λᴿ parameter grid  
  (0 = fragile, 1 = stable, 2 = runaway).

- kappa_ps.csv  
  Power-spectrum values Pκ(k) vs. k.

- hmf.csv  
  κ-clumping halo-mass-function analogue.

- pk.csv  
  Alternative Pκ(k) estimator used for verification.

### 🔹 **Summary**

- summary.json  
  Machine-readable summary of the selected baseline run  
  (final coherence metrics, operator values, pruning totals, etc.).

- summary.png  
  Screenshot-style visualisation of the same summary data.

## Reproducibility

All results here are generated from scripts in:

UIF/code/cosmology_lite_experiment/

Inputs come exclusively from the emulator (no external datasets).  
To regenerate the outputs:

1. Run baseline:
   python ut26_cosmo3d.py

2. Run operator sweeps:
   python run_gamma_sweep.py
   python run_threshold_map.py

3. Generate figures:
   python plot_gamma_2x2.py
   python plot_gamma_sweep_heatmap.py
   python plot_threshold_heatmap.py
   python ut26_cosmo3d_hysteresis.py

All scripts are deterministic given the random seed set in each file.

- Figures included in the paper are exported directly from this directory.  
- CSV tables are the numerical source for stability, calibration,  
  and operator analyses in the manuscript.
