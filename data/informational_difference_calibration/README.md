# Informational Difference Calibration Experiment Data

This folder contains documentation for the data dependencies of the UIF Informational Difference Calibration experiment (UIF Companion Experiments Paper - **Experiment 1**) which utilised the Cosmology-Lite synthetic 3-D lattice universe emulator used for operator exploration and validation (Experiments I–V). It contains the data for the synthetic collapse–return fields, operator sweeps, and diagnostic figures that appear in the Companion and in **UIF Paper IV**.

## Description

The Cosmology-Lite Experiment is a fully synthetic simulation.
It does not require observational or external datasets.
All metrics used in the UIF Companion Experiments are generated internally by the simulator, including:

- Mean coherence trajectories 〈s(t)〉
- Pruning curves and cumulative pruning P(t)
- κ-maps and κ power spectra P(k)
- Stability sweeps across (η*, λᴿ)
- Logistic coherence curves and hysteresis loops
- γ-sweep and threshold maps
- Collapse-return equilibrium diagnostics (R∞, k, Γ, η*, λᴿ)

The inputs to the emulator are model parameters only, supplied via:
`UIF/code/informational_difference_calibration_experiement/`

The outputs are stored in:
`UIF/output/cosmology_lite_experiment/`

## File Structure

This directory intentionally remains minimal:

- `README.md` — This documentation file  
- **No external data files**  
  (All data is generated by the emulator.)

All emulator data products are synthetic.

## Provenance

Although the emulator is synthetic, its operator ranges were conceptually informed by quasar coherence patterns measured from SDSS Stripe 82, which are stored in:

`UIF/data/quasar_cosmology_experiment/`

However, **no observational data is used directly** in this experiment.
