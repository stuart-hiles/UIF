# Quasar Variability Experiment — Data

This folder is reserved for future UIF experiments involving quasar variability.

## Status

No datasets are included here yet. The variability experiment is planned to use
time-domain light-curve data (e.g., CRTS, ZTF, OGLE) to test temporal coherence,
operator drift, ΔI trajectories, and collapse–return dynamics in quasar variability.

## Related Work

The current UIF quasar analyses are implemented in:

- `/code/quasar_scaling_experiment/`
- `/code/quasar_coherence_experiment/`
- `/data/quasar_cosmology_experiment/`

Those experiments use SDSS Stripe-82 coherence and scaling datasets.

## Planned Data (Future)

This folder will eventually hold:

- Raw and processed quasar light-curve time series  
- Feature-extracted temporal statistics (structure functions, PSD slopes, DRW τ, σ)  
- UIF temporal-operator outputs (ΔI(t), κ(t), Γ(t), hysteresis traces)  
- Bootstrapped variability operator estimates
