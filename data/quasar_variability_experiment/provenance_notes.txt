UIF — Quasar Variability Experiment
Provenance Notes
-------------------------------

This folder contains the processed datasets used in the
UIF Companion Experiment VII — Quasar Variability and Informational Coherence.

Raw astronomical time-series and SDSS catalogs are *not* redistributed here.
All data products in this directory were derived from publicly available
surveys and cleaned into analysis-ready CSV tables.

Source Catalogs (Raw Inputs)
----------------------------
The following raw SDSS Stripe 82 quasar catalogs were used:

- master_QSO_S82.dat
- DB_QSO_S82.dat
- DRW variability parameter tables: s82drw_*.dat

These files are publicly available from the SDSS Southern Stripe 82 QSO
catalogue maintained by MacLeod et al.:

  https://faculty.washington.edu/ivezic/macleod/qso_s82/

Processing Summary
------------------
The processed CSVs in this folder were generated using the UIF Python
pipelines under:

    UIF/code/quasar_scaling_experiment/
    UIF/code/quasar_variability_experiment/

Processing steps included:
1. Import Stripe 82 master catalog and DRW parameter tables.
2. Merge photometric, redshift, and DRW timescale/amplitude data.
3. Clean missing/invalid entries and enforce quality flags.
4. Compute:
      - entropy H
      - complexity C
      - coherence index R
      - ΔIσ variability metric
      - τ–M_BH and τ–M_i scaling quantities
5. Export final analysis tables used in UIF Experiment VII.

Files Included (Processed Outputs)
----------------------------------
- quasar_raw_HC_all.csv
    Combined H–C–R feature table for all quasars.

- quasar_variability_operators.csv
    Redshift-binned UIF operator estimates
    (ΔI_sigma_std, Γ_slope, λR_highR_fraction, Rinf_proxy, k_proxy).

- UT26_quasar_scaling_slopes.csv
    Mass, luminosity, and variability scaling-law slopes and uncertainties.
