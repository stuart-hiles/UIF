# UIF Data Directory

This directory contains all input datasets used across the UIF Companion Experiments, organised
by experiment type. Each subfolder includes its own README.md describing data provenance,
formats, licensing, and reproducibility details.

No raw proprietary datasets are redistributed. All externally sourced datasets must be obtained
from their original providers (e.g., PhysioNet, SDSS, Stripe 82) according to their licenses.
Only derived or user-generated intermediate CSVs are included where redistribution is permitted.

## 📁 Directory Structure

### `/cosmology_lite_experiment/`
Contains *no raw data*.  
This experiment uses only synthetic data generated by the UIF cosmology-lite emulator.  
Inputs are defined entirely in `/code/cosmology_lite_experiment/`.

### `/eeg_coherence_experiment/`
Contains subject/run manifest files, metadata, and helper JSON needed for EEG processing.  
**No .edf EEG recordings are stored here.**  
Users must download BCI2000 Motor/Imagery recordings directly from PhysioNet  
(doi: 10.13026/C28G6P).

See this folder’s README for access instructions and metadata descriptions.

### `/quasar_coherence_experiment/`
Contains quasar coherence-analysis inputs, including:
- `quasar_raw_HC_all.csv` (derived raw coherence metrics)
These files were generated from public SDSS Stripe 82 light-curve datasets.
No raw light curves are redistributed.

### `/quasar_cosmology_experiment/`
Contains three processed CSV files derived from the SDSS Stripe 82 master dataset:
- `i_dat_raw.csv`
- `master_raw.csv`
- `merged_1arcsec.csv`

These are pre-merged and cleaned versions of the public Stripe 82 catalogs.  
Original sources must be cited (SDSS DR7/DR5 + Stripe 82 light-curve program).

### `/quasar_scaling_experiment/`
Contains inputs used for operator scaling, including:
- `quasar_raw_HC_all.csv`
- `ut26_R_binned_boot.csv`

These correspond to the scaling and HC-plane fits used in the UIF Companion Experiments.

### `/quasar_variability_experiment/`
Reserved for *future* time-domain quasar variability data (DRW fits, τ–σ parameters, etc.).  
Currently empty.

## 🔍 Notes on Data Licensing

- **PhysioNet datasets** (EEG): governed by the PhysioNet license; raw recordings must be downloaded by users.
- **SDSS Stripe 82 datasets** (quasar): governed by SDSS data release policies; original catalogs are not stored here.
- **Synthetic emulator data**: created by UIF and licenced under CC BY-NC 4.0.
- **Derived CSVs**: included where redistribution is permitted, and fully documented in each subfolder.
