# The Unifying Information Field (UIF)

**UIF** is a unified theoretical and empirical framework that models reality as an *informational field* governed by collapseâ€“return dynamics.  
It links quantum, cosmological, biological, and cognitive systems through a single set of informational operators:
Î”I (informational difference), Î“ (recursion/coherence), Î² (bias), Î»_R (receiveâ€“return coupling), R_âˆž (coherence ceiling), k (recharge rate), and Î· (threshold).

The UIF series (Papers Iâ€“VII) establishes:
- a **variational principle** for informational exchange,
- **operator-level symmetry laws** unifying quantum and classical behaviour,
- **empirical tests** across domainsâ€”from M87 EHT polarization and JWST coherence data to EEG synchronisation and CHREM experiments.

### ðŸ“š Contents
- **Paper I â€“ Core Theory**: collapseâ€“return operator grammar and the seven pillars of informational dynamics.  
- **Paper II â€“ Symmetry Principles**: conservation and invariance conditions for informational difference (Î”I).  
- **Paper III â€“ Field & Lagrangian Formalism**: variational field equations and Noether currents.  
- **Paper IV â€“ Cosmology & Astrophysical Case Studies**: large-scale coherence, quasars, and dark substrate signatures.  
- **Paper V â€“ Energy & the Potential Field**: energetic formalism linking information, energy, and coherence.  
- **Paper VI â€“ Seven Pillars & Invariants**: unified topology of forces and conserved informational quantities.  
- **Paper VII â€“ Predictions & Experiments**: empirical validation across physical, biological, and artificial systems.  
- **Companion Volume**: symbolic derivations, calibration data, and reproducibility notebooks.

### ðŸ§  Core idea
Reality is informational: each collapse redistributes Î”I between local systems and the substrate field R(x,t), producing measurable coherence, hysteresis, and agency.  
Physics, computation, and consciousness are expressions of one recursive lawâ€”**collapse, recursion, return**.
